"""Sync the course and handbook READMEs with the editorial order below.

COURSE and TRACKS hold each folder's title, blurb and page order. This script
checks every listed page exists, renders it once as a sanity check, and writes
docs/<folder>/README.md so the order on GitHub and on the site agree. The site
reads that order back from the READMEs:

    pip install markdown
    python3 scripts/build_tracks.py
    python3 tools/build_graph_site.py

It used to inject the pages into the old single-file index.html; the graph
page has its own builder now, so index.html is not touched here.
