The site at [undefined-ui.github.io/second-brain-os](https://undefined-ui.github.io/second-brain-os/)
is generated from this repository, so it cannot drift from the guide.

## The home page: one graph of the whole site

```bash
pip install markdown
python3 tools/build_graph_site.py   # -> assets/site/graph-data.js, assets/site/pages-data.js
python3 -m http.server 4173         # then open http://localhost:4173
```

`index.html` draws every section, page, term, skill, command, subagent, script
and resource as a node in a 3D graph, and every real link between them as an
edge. Click a node to fly to it, see what it links to and what links to it, and
open a page in the reader without leaving the graph.

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | The page shell. Hand-written |
| `assets/site/app.css` | Layout and type. Palette and fonts are the guide's |
| `assets/site/app.js` | The graph, the panels, the reader, search, routing |
| `assets/site/graph-data.js` | Generated: nodes and edges |
| `assets/site/pages-data.js` | Generated: rendered guide pages |
| `tools/build_graph_site.py` | Builds both data files from the markdown |
| `tools/glossary.json` | The only hand-kept data: the terms on the graph |

`build_graph_site.py` keeps the reading order declared in each section's
`README.md`, resolves every relative link to a page, section or toolkit node,
links commands to the skill they follow, pages to the resources whose URLs they
cite, and terms to the pages that mention them most. Add a term by adding a line
to `glossary.json` and rerunning.

The graph is drawn with [3d-force-graph](https://github.com/vasturiano/3d-force-graph)
and three.js, loaded from jsDelivr at pinned versions. Everything else is in the
repo. Old links such as `index.html#02-setup/claude-md` still open that page.

## The other pages

```bash
python3 tools/extract_site.py   # docs and resources -> site_data.json
python3 tools/build_site.py     # -> resources.html
python3 scripts/build_tree.py   # -> tree.html
```

`resources.html` and `tree.html` are still built the old way. Neither script
touches `index.html`, and neither does `scripts/build_tracks.py`, which now only
keeps the course and handbook READMEs in the declared order.
